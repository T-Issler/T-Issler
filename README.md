## Huhu, I am Teresa ðŸ‘‹
### My Job is to ensure all snapADDY Customers enjoy a great experience using our awesome products!

With a bunch of people in my life being some kind of coding sepcialist, I have picked up bits and pieces of knowledge troughout the years.

My experience covers programming simple Arduino microcontrollers and basic Python commands.

If you have programmed something fun or are learning somethin new, please don't hesitate to tell me all about it, my curiosity knows no bounds.
I want to deepen my understanding of various programming languages and learn even more cool stuff in the future!
